KEY SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES USED - 

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries to ensure the dataset is ready for model training.

Data Visualization: Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful visualizations, helping us understand the relationships between different variables and uncover patterns in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Applied transformation techniques to prepare data for better model performance, such as encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and handling skewed data.

Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Implemented algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to compare model accuracy and select the best-performing model.

Deep Learning (Keras): Built a Deep Neural Network using the Keras framework to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, improving predictive accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure their effectiveness in predicting loan repayment status.

PROBLEM STATEMENT - 

The problem at hand is predicting whether a customer will repay a loan or default on it. By analyzing various features such as customer income, credit history, loan amount, and term length, the goal is to train a machine learning model that can make reliable predictions about loan repayment behavior.

This model is a great demonstration of real-world machine learning techniques, combining data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and model training in one comprehensive pipeline. It offers valuable insights for financial institutions, enabling them to make data-driven decisions about loan approvals.
